Building cpp-netlib
===================

Clone the Git cpp-netlib sources (https://github.com/cpp-netlib/cpp-netlib.git),
into some directory somewhere (just underneath this directory, for instance),
then run the command:

$ bash build_linux-x64.bash SRCDIR

Where SRCDIR is the directory in which the cpp-netlib Git repo was just cloned.

Afterwards, verify that the cpp-netlib header files have been installed in ../prefix_linux-x64/include.
